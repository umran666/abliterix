"""Offline "edit-and-repack" bake path for native FP4 (MXFP4 / NVFP4) models.

Direct/EGA abliteration edits only a *subset* of a model's tensors (fused
expert ``down_proj``, ``attn.o_proj``, dense ``mlp.down_proj``), and each edit
is *local* to one tensor. That is the lever this module pulls: instead of
expanding a 284B FP4 checkpoint to ~568GB of BF16 just to steer it (2×+ the
footprint, 4× B200), it streams the original FP4 checkpoint shard by shard and,
for each edited tensor only, does ``dequant → project → re-pack to the same
FP4 format`` — every other tensor is copied through byte-for-byte. Peak memory
is a single layer's expert block, and the output is a clean standalone FP4
checkpoint that loads in any NVFP4/MXFP4-capable stack with no special support.

This is the counterpart of :func:`abliterix.core.fp8_utils.dequant_model_to_disk`
(FP8 → BF16 on disk) but it keeps the model 4-bit end to end.

Two-phase workflow
------------------
1. **Search / export** (model loaded at any precision): call
   :func:`record_steering_plan` at the moment the engine would apply the best
   trial. It records the resolved per-tensor edits (direction + strength +
   projection geometry) keyed by canonical parameter name — cheap, no extra
   memory beyond the already-loaded model.
2. **Bake** (single GPU, streams disk): :func:`abliterate_fp4_to_disk` replays
   that plan against the original FP4 shards.

Faithfulness
    The projection math is the *shared* :mod:`abliterix.weight_transforms`
    kernels the in-engine HF path uses, so the abliteration fingerprint is
    bit-identical. EGA axis is re-resolved from the on-disk dequantised shape
    (via recorded ``hidden_dim`` + ``transposed``) so a producer that stores
    experts transposed (gpt-oss) still steers the correct axis. Before writing,
    each source FP4 tensor is cross-checked against the model's own dequant
    when a reference is supplied (see :func:`abliterate_fp4_to_disk`).
